## WHAT IS FOR 
If you don't know how to model or want to make a lot of names this is your tool!
I made this to learn the geometry nodes on the blender and to help a friend!

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
I do not have test it out!

## What you need! 

Blender
Inkscape (some vector graphics editor)

### Inkscape

This is a vector program creator or editor, you have to choose to design
We have to use this because blender as far as I know doesn't have any node to boolean 2dcurves and because of that, we have to boolean the curves on Inkscape.
First
Open Inkscape and create a text, then convert the text to curves and explode it! 
To finalize you ADD a boolean for all the letters and save the SVG

### Blender

1. Open the File that is on git
2. erase the name that is there
3. import the name SVG that you made on Inkscape
4. Select and go to the options curve options proprieties and disable fill mode

5.  Select the TEXT and go to the modifiers tab
6. Add a geometry node
7. Select NAME LED geometry node

### Last thought

I love to learn new tools, and being an old blender user is a good feeling to see its development.
Thanks to Vitor Madureira to give me the motivation and chance to help out and maybe help a lot of people.
